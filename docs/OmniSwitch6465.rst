OmniSwitch 6465 Hardened Access Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ruggedized, fully manageable and scalable Gigabit Ethernet switch. 
Designed for Industrial Ethernet, these DIN rail switches are ideal for a range of Industrial applications such as Intelligent Transportation, Railway and Substations.
The Alcatel Lucent OmniSwitch 6465 switches are fully managed, gigabit Ethernet switches run on the widely deployed & field-proven Alcatel-Lucent operating system offering high security, reliability, performance and easy management. These switches are designed to operate in extended temperatures, offer higher EMI/EMC tolerance and surge protection.

The OS6465 series offers HPoE (60W PoE) for connecting the pan-tilt-zoom cameras on toll booths, outdoor wireless access points or integrated displays. These switches are easy to deploy with Alcatel-Lucent Enterpriseâ€™ award winning Auto-Fabric technology which offers out-of-the-box plug-and-play, zero-touch provisioning and network automation. These switches support IEEE 1588v2 PTP for timing requirements of industrial devices. The OS6465 family offers advanced system and network level resiliency features and convergence through standardized protocols in a space-efficient form factor.

These versatile industrial switches are ideal for deployment in transportation and traffic control systems, power utilities, IP surveillance systems and outdoor installations.
