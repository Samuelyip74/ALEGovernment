<h3>L2/L3 VPN<a class="headerlink" href="#l2-l3-vpn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The concept of L3 VPNs for government agencies, schools and hospitals is shown in the figure below.
In this diagram, schools, hospitals and other government agencies are tenants of the city net and each have their own L3 VPN. VPN technology ensures all these different tenants can coexist on the same infrastructure and that tenant data is kept private from other tenants.
In a L3 VPN, tenants exchange routes with the city net and the city net routes tenant data from site to site over the most optimal route without traffic tromboning back and forth to a central site for routing.
In addition, tenant data is isolated from other tenants and tenant routes are not advertised to other tenants.</p>

<h3>MPLS vs SPB<a class="headerlink" href="#mpls-vs-spb" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Even since Layer 3 VPN is implemented in SPB, there has been a lot of debate with the use of SPB as an alternative to MPLS.
Below are some of the common arguments we shared with our customers.</p>

<h3>OmniSwitch SPB<a class="headerlink" href="#omniswitch-spb" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The OmniSwitch implementation of Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) supports SPB MAC (SPBM) as defined in the IEEE 802.1aq standard.
SPBM is defined for use in Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) networks as specified in the IEEE 802.1ah standard.
SPBM provides a mechanism to automatically define a shortest path tree (SPT) bridging configuration through a Layer 2 Ethernet network. SPBM Ethernet services use this configuration to encapsulate and tunnel data through the PBB network. The following main components of the OmniSwitch implementation of SPBM provide this type of functionality:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ISIS-SPB—A version of the Intermediate to Intermediate System (IS-IS) link state protocol that supports SPB TLV extensions. SPBM uses ISIS-SPB to build sets of symmetric shortest path trees (SPTs) between any SPB switch.</li>
<li>Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) IEEE 802.1ah— Defines a MAC-in-MAC data encapsulation path for PBB networks that is supported by SPBM.</li>
<li>Provider Backbone Bridge Network (PBBN)—A network comprised of Backbone Edge Bridges (BEBs) and Backbone Core Bridges (BCB) that is used to interconnect Provider Bridge Networks (PBN) with other networks.</li>
<li>Backbone Edge Bridge (BEB)—An SPB switch positioned at the edge of the PBB network that learns and encapsulates (adds an 802.1ah backbone header to) customer frames for transport across the backbone network. The BEB interconnects the customer network space with PBB network space.</li>
<li>Backbone Core Bridge (BCB)—An SPB node that resides inside the PBB network core. The BCB employs the same BVLAN on two or more network ports. This BVLAN does not terminate on the switch itself; traffic ingressing on an SPB network port is switched to other SPB network ports. As a result, the BCB does not have to learn any of the customer MAC addresses. It mainly serves as a transit bridge for the PBB network.</li>
<li>SPBM Service—An OmniSwitch Service Manager service configured on the BEBs. Each service maps to a service instance identifier (I-SID) which is bound to a backbone VLAN. One backbone VLAN can accommodate multiple I-SIDs.</li>
<li>Backbone VLAN (BVLAN)—A VLAN that serves as a transport VLAN for the SPBM service instances and to connect SPB bridges together through SPT sets. Unlike standard VLANs, BVLANs do not learn source MAC addresses or flood unknown destination or multicast frames. Instead, BVLANs only forward on the basis of the forwarding database (FDB) as populated by the ISIS-SPB protocol.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spbm-shortest-path-trees">
<h3>SPBM Shortest Path Trees<a class="headerlink" href="#spbm-shortest-path-trees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The shortest path between two points is a straight line. Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) implements frame forwarding on the shortest path between any two bridges in an Ethernet network. The shortest path trees (SPTs) calculated by SPB provide the shortest and most efficient path to and from the intended destination. SPTs are formed along the direct, straight-line links between switches to make up an overall path through the topology that provides a robust, efficient direction for network traffic to travel.
The SPBM network topology consists of two layers:
* The backbone infrastructure (control plane) layer. ISIS-SPB builds the backbone layer by defining loop-free, shortest path trees (SPTs) through the backbone network.
* The services (data plane) layer. The service layer is based on the Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) framework as defined in the IEEE 802.1ah standard. SPBM supports the 802.1ah MAC-in-MAC method for data encapsulation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spb-services">
<h3>SPB Services<a class="headerlink" href="#spb-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The SPBM network topology consists of two layers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The backbone infrastructure (control plane) layer. ISIS-SPB builds the backbone layer by defining loop-free, shortest path trees (SPTs) through the backbone network.</li>
<li>The services (data plane) layer. The service layer is based on the Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) framework as defined in the IEEE 802.1ah standard. SPBM supports the 802.1ah MAC-in-MAC method for data encapsulation. SPBM services transport the encapsulated traffic over the ISIS-SPB infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SPB service layer framework is comprised of the following components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Backbone Edge Bridge (BEB). An OmniSwitch is considered a BEB if the switch is SPB capable and at least one service access point (SAP) and one SPB interface is configured on the switch. The BEB marks the boundary between the customer network and the PBB network (PBBN).</li>
<li>Backbone Core Bridge (BCB). An OmniSwitch is considered a BCB if the switch is SPB capable and no SAPs are configured but at least one SPB interface is configured on the switch to forward encapsulated SPBM network traffic. Note that the requirement for configuring a BCB is based on whether or not the network topology includes a transit bridge.</li>
<li>Service Instance Identifier (I-SID). Configured only on a BEB, this component identifies a backbone service instance that will tunnel the encapsulated data traffic through the PBBN between BEBs. The I- SID is bound to a BVLAN ID and a Service Manager SPB service ID when the service is created.</li>
<li>Access Port. A port or link aggregate configured as an SPB access port. This type of port is configured on the BEBs and defines the point at which traffic from other provider networks or directly from customer networks enters the PBBN. The access port is also associated with a Layer 2 profile that specifies how to process protocol control frames received on the port</li>
<li>Service Access Point (SAP)—A SAP is a logical service entity (also referred to as a virtual port) that is configured on a BEB to bind an access port to an SPB service ID and specify the type of customer traffic ((untagged, single-tagged, double-tagged, or all) to encapsulate and tunnel through the PBBN.</li>
<li>SPB Interface (Network Port)—A port or link aggregate configured as an SPB interface that resides on either a BEB or a BCB and connects to the backbone network. Network ports carry customer traffic encapsulated in 802.1ah frames and are associated with all BVLANs on the switch. Customer traffic ingressing on a network port is switched to another network port (on BCBs) or to an access port (on BEBs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the ISIS-SPB infrastructure and the SPB service-based architecture is defined, the following service components are dynamically created by the OmniSwitch. No user-configuration is required.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Service Distribution Point (SDP)—A SDP provides a logical point at which customer traffic is directed from one BEB to another BEB. SDPs are used to set up distributed services, which consist of at least one SAP on a local node, one SAP on a remote node, and an SDP binding the service on both nodes.</li>
<li>SDP Bind—An SDP binding represents the binding of an SPB service instance to an SDP. The SDP then distributes the service connectivity to other BEBs through the ISIS-SPB shortest path trees.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="ip-over-spbm">
<h3>IP over SPBM<a class="headerlink" href="#ip-over-spbm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The OmniSwitch implementation of SPBM provides L2 VPN capability that bridges L2 customer LAN segments. Customer edge (CE) devices form peers and exchange routing information, as well as perform the necessary IP forwarding. Then the SPBM BEBs bridge the already routed IP traffic across the SPBM backbone.
In addition to L2 VPN, the OmniSwitch also provides an IP over SPBM capability that consolidates the routing functionality of CE devices into the BEB devices. The Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instances on different BEBs are tied together via backbone I-SIDs across the same SPBM backbone that is used to support Layer 2 VPNs.
The OmniSwitch IP over SPBM solution supports two methods for combining L3 routing and L2 SPBM in the same switch: VPN-Lite and L3 VPN.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="l3-vpn">
<h3>L3 VPN<a class="headerlink" href="#l3-vpn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When the L3 VPN method is implemented, the OmniSwitch acts as an access or edge router to multiple VRFs and connects these VRFs across an SPBM PBB network. Each VPN is identified by a local VRF instance on each BEB and globally in the backbone by an I-SID in the PBB header. ISIS-SPB will import and export routes from the local routing protocols running inside their respective VRFs. In essence, ISIS- SPB is creating tunnels between BEBs through which routed frames are sent to reach their target networks.
The OmniSwitch L3 VPN solution is based on the IETF drafts IP/IPVPN services with IEEE 802.1aq SPB(B) networks and uses IS-IS TLVs to exchange routes between the BEBs that host the same VPN services. This approach also gives an administrator the ability to build VPNs and extend them over an SPBM core.</p>

<h3>Create SPB service<a class="headerlink" href="#create-spb-service" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An SPB service is identified by a service ID number, which represents an association between a backbone service instance identifier (I-SID) and an existing BVLAN. Basically, creating an SPB service binds the backbone I-SID to a BVLAN ID. All traffic mapped to the specific I-SID is then encapsulated and forwarded on the associated BVLAN to the intended destination.
The service spb command is used to create an SPB service. For example, the following command creates SPB service 1 and binds I-SID 100 to BVLAN 4001:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">-&gt; service 1 spb isid 500 bvlan 4001 admin-state enable</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The BVLAN ID specified with the service spb command must already exist in the switch configuration. However, the I-SID number specified creates a new I-SID that is bound to the BVLAN for this service.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">When adding another BVLAN to an existing SPBM topology instance, create the new BVLAN and its associated ECT ID on every switch first, then configure the SPB service association for the BVLAN. Creating SPB services before the BVLAN configuration is complete on all switches can cause problems with forming adjacencies or may even cause an SPB switch to drop existing adjacencies.</p>

<h3>Using VLAN Translation<a class="headerlink" href="#using-vlan-translation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>VLAN translation refers to the egress translation of VLAN tags on service access points (SAPs). When enabled for a service, the VLAN tags for outgoing customer frames on SAPs associated with that service are processed according to the local SAP configuration (the SAP on which the frames will egress) and not according to the configuration of the SAP on which the frames were received.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the local SAP is configured for untagged traffic (slot/port:0), the egress traffic is always sent out as untagged.</li>
<li>If the local SAP is configured for 802.1q-tagged traffic (slot/port:ctag), the egress traffic is single- tagged with the tag value specified by the ctag (customer VLAN tag) value.</li>
<li>If the local SAP is configured for double-tagged traffic (slot/port:outer_tag.: inner_tag), the egress traffic is double-tagged with the tag values specified by the outer_tag and inner_tag values.</li>
</ul>
<p>When VLAN translation is disabled, frames simply egress without any modification of the VLAN tags. In other words, the frames are transparently bridged without tag modification.
The following table shows the required translation (tag is added or replaced) that takes place when the egress SAP configuration is applied to the possible frame types (untagged, tagged, double-tagged). Note that in this table the terms “ITAG” and “OTAG” refer to inner tag and outer tag, respectively.</p>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/saptags.png"><img alt="alternate text" src="_images/saptags.png" style="width: 800px; height: 300px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Enabling VLAN translation is required at two different levels: first at the access port level and then at the service level. This activates VLAN translation for all of the SAPs on an access port that belong to the same service.
To enable translation at the service level, use the service vlan-xlation command. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">-&gt; service 1 vlan-xlation enable</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To enable VLAN translation for all services, use the all parameter with the same command. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">-&gt; service all vlan-xlation enable</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To enable VLAN translation at the access port level, use the service access vlan-xlation command. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">-&gt; service access port 1/11 vlan-xlation enable</span>

<h3>Enable the Service<a class="headerlink" href="#enable-the-service" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By default, the SPB service is disabled when the service is created. Once the service is created and any optional service parameters are configured, use the service admin-state command with the enable option to enable the service. For example:</p>

<h3>Configure the SAP points<a class="headerlink" href="#configure-the-sap-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A SAP identifies the location where customer traffic enters the Provider Backbone Bridge Network (PBBN) edge, the type of customer traffic to service, parameters to apply to the traffic, and the service that will process the traffic for tunneling through the provider network.
Configuring a SAP requires several steps. These steps are outlined here and further described throughout this section:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Configure customer-facing ports or link aggregates as service access ports.</li>
<li>Configure Layer 2 profiles to determine how control packets are processed on access ports.</li>
<li>Create a SAP by associating a SAP ID with an SPB service ID. A SAP ID is comprised of an access port and an encapsulation value, which is used to identify the type of customer traffic (untagged, single-tagged, or double-tagged) to map to the associated service.</li>
</ul>
<p>To configure a port or link aggregate as an access port, use the service access command. For example, the following command configures port 1/2 and link aggregate 5 as access ports:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">-&gt; service access port 1/2</span>

<h3>VLAN Translation on Access Ports<a class="headerlink" href="#vlan-translation-on-access-ports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>VLAN translation refers to the egress translation of VLAN tags on service access points (SAPs). For more information about how VLAN translation is applied, see “Using VLAN Translation” on page 7-40.
By default, VLAN translation is disabled on access ports. Enabling VLAN translation on an access port implicitly enables translation for all SAPs associated with that port. However, translation must also be enabled for the services associated with these SAPs. This ensures that all SAPs associated with a service will apply VLAN translation.
To enable VLAN translation on an access port, use the service access vlan-xlation command with the enable option. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">-&gt; service access port 1/3 vlan-xlation enable</span>

<h3>Configuring Layer 2 Profiles for Access Ports<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-layer-2-profiles-for-access-ports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A Layer 2 profile determines how control frames ingressing on an access port are processed. When a port is configured as an access port, a default Layer 2 profile (def-access-profile) is applied to the port with the following default values for processing control frames:</p>
<div class="align-center figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/l2profile.png"><img alt="alternate text" src="_images/l2profile.png" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>If the default profile values are not sufficient, use the service l2profile command with the tunnel, drop, and peer options to create a new profile. For example, the following command creates a profile named “DropL2”:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">-&gt; service l2profile DropL2 stp drop gvrp drop 802.1ab drop</span>

<h3>Assigning Layer 2 Profiles to Access Ports<a class="headerlink" href="#assigning-layer-2-profiles-to-access-ports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After a Layer 2 profile is created, it is then necessary to assign the profile to an access port or link aggregate. When this is done, the current profile associated with the port is replaced with the new profile.
The service access l2profile command is used to assign a new profile to an access port. For example, the following command assigns the “DropL2” profile to access port 1/4 and link aggregate 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">-&gt; service access port 1/4 l2profile DropL2</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; service access linkagg 5 l2profile DropL2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To change the profile associated with the access port back to the default profile (def-access-profile), use the default option with the service access l2profile command. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">-&gt; service port 1/4 l2profile default</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; service access linkagg 5 l2profile default</span>

<div class="section" id="creating-the-service-access-point">
<h3>Creating the Service Access Point<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-the-service-access-point" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each SPB service is bound to at least one Service Access Point (SAP). A SAP identifies the point at which customer traffic enters the Provider Backbone Bridge Network (PBBN). Creating a SAP on an SPB switch designates that switch as a Backbone Edge Bridge (BEB) in the PBBN. An SPB switch that does not have a SAP but does have at least one BVLAN and an SPB interface is designated as Backbone Core Bridge (BCB) in the PBBN.
Once the SPB topology is determined and switches that will serve as BEBs are identified, a SAP is created on each BEB. A SAP is created by associating a SAP ID with an SPB service. A SAP ID is comprised of a customer-facing port (referred to as an access port) and an encapsulation value that is used to identify the type of customer traffic (untagged, single-tagged, or double-tagged) to map to the associated service.
The service sap command is used to configure a SAP. This command specifies the SPB service ID number and the SAP ID (slot/port:encapsulation). The following parameter values are used with this command to specify the encapsulation value:</p>
<div class="align-center figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/sapencap.png"><img alt="alternate text" src="_images/sapencap.png" style="width: 500px; height: 200px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">:all (wildcard) parameter is also configurable as the inner tag value for double-tagged frames (for example, “10:all” specifies double-tagged packets with an outer tag equal to 10 and an inner tag with any value).</p>
</div>
<p>The following service sap command example creates a SAP that will direct customer traffic ingressing on access port 1/4 that is tagged with VLAN ID 50 to service 100:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">-&gt; service 100 sap 1/4:50 description “BEB1 to SPB100 CVLAN 50”</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the above example, the 1/4:50 designation is referred to as the SAP ID or the encapsulation ID. This means that if no other SAPs are configured for port 1/4, then any traffic ingressing on that port is dropped if the traffic is not tagged with VLAN 50.
It is possible to configure more than one SAP for the same access port, which provides a method for segregating incoming traffic into multiple services. For example, the following SAP configuration for port 2/3 sends incoming traffic to three different services based on the VLAN tags of the frames received:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">-&gt; service 2000 sap port 2/3:all</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; service 200 sap port 2/3:100</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; service 1000 sap port 2/3:100.200</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this example,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Frames double-tagged with 100 (outer tag) and 200 (inner tag) are sent on service 1000.</li>
<li>Frames single-tagged with VLAN 100 are sent on service 200.</li>
<li>All other frames (those that are not single-tagged with 100 or double-tagged with 100 and 200) are sent on service 2000</li>
</ul>
<p>The following SAP ID classification precedence is applied when there are multiple SAPs for one access port:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Double-tagged (Outer VLAN + Inner VLAN) - Highest</li>
<li>Double-tagged (Outer VLAN + all)</li>
<li>Single-tagged (VLAN)</li>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this example, the “IPv4-L3vpn3” and “IPv6-L3vpn4” interfaces are created in the “vrf-1” instance and bound to SPB service 10. See “IPv4 L3 VPN In-Line Routing: Two I-SIDS, Two VRFs” on page 7-62 for an example configuration of an L3 VPN service-based interface.</p>
<p><strong>Configuring the L3 VPN (SPB-ISIS) Solution</strong></p>
<p>The L3 VPN (SPB-ISIS) approach requires configuring a VRF-ISID binding to identify the L3 VPN interface that will exchange routes between the VLAN domain (VRF instance) and the SPB service domain (I-SID). VRF import and export commands are used to exchange routes between the VRF and the I-SID specified in the binding configuration. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; ip export all-routes</span>
<span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; vrf default</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; spb ipvpn bind vrf-1 isid 1000 gateway 10.1.1.1 all-routes</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; vrf vrf-1</span>
<span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; ip import isid 1000 all-routes</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this example, “vrf-1” is bound to SPB I-SID 1000 and gateway 10.1.1.1 identifies the IPv4 L3 VPN interface. All IPv4 routes in “vrf-1” are exported to the Global Route Manager (GRM), which then exports the routes to I-SID 1000. The last command in this sequence sets up the import of I-SID 1000 routes from the GRM into the “vrf-1” instance. The all-routes parameter specifies that no route-map filtering is applied to exported or imported routes; all routes are allowed.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; ipv6 export all-routes</span>
<span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; vrf default</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; spb ipvpn6 bind vrf-1 isid 3000 gateway 1000::1</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; vrf vrf-1</span>
<span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; ipv6 import isid 3000 all-routes</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In this example, “vrf-1” is bound to SPB I-SID 3000 and gateway 1000::1 identifies the IPv6 L3 VPN interface. All IPv6 routes in “vrf-1” are exported to the GRM, which then exports the routes to I-SID 3000. The last command in this sequence sets up the import of I-SID 3000 routes from the GRM into the “vrf-1” instance. The all-routes parameter specifies that no route-map filtering is applied to exported or imported routes; all routes are allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering Imported or Exported Routes</strong></p>
<p>To filter routes that are imported or exported, define a route map to use with the ip import or ip export commands. For example, the following commands create the “ipvpn-vrf1” route map and filter exported and imported routes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; ip access-list ipaddr</span>
<span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; ip access-list ipaddr address 15.0.0.0/8 action permit redist-control</span>
<span class="go">all-subnets</span>
<span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; ip route-map ipvpn-vrf1 sequence-number 1 action permit</span>
<span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; ip route-map ipvpn-vrf1 sequence-number 1 match ip-address ipaddr</span>
<span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; ip export ipvpn-vrf1</span>

<span class="go">vrf-1::-&gt; ipv6 import isid 3000 ipvpn6-vrf1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Configuring Route Redistribution Between VRFs and/or I-SIDs
The L3 VPN (SPB-ISIS) solution also allows for the redistribution of routes between a VRF instance and an I-SID or between two I-SIDs (inter-I-SID route leaking). For example, the following commands redistribute routes from I-SID 2000 into I-SID 1000, from “vrf-1” into I-SID 2000, from I-SID 4000 into I-SID 3000, and from “vrf-1” into I-SID 4000.</p>

<p><strong>Verifying L3 VPN Configuration and Routes</strong></p>
<p>VRFs are bound to I-SIDs to identify a VRF mapping to a specific SPB service instance for the purposes of exchanging routes between the VRF and I-SID via the switch GRM. To verify the VRF mapping configuration on the local switch, use the show spb ipvpn bind or show spb ipvpn6 bind command. For example:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>OmniSwitch implements a Multi-layered Security approach to secure the data, control and management plane of the switch.
The following sections covered the various security implementations:</p>
<div class="section" id="data-plane">
<h3>Data plane<a class="headerlink" href="#data-plane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The figure below shown the various features used to protect the data plane of the switch.
At the edge, access guardian feature in OmniSwitch provide network access control functionality
to authentication the user/device based on any of the following methods:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>MAC authentication</li>
<li>Captive Portal, or</li>
<li>802.1x authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>OmniSwitch supports Radius, Tacacs+, LDAP and RSA for authentication.</p>
<p>If access guardian is not enabled, administrator can implement rogue device detection capability
to protect the switch from unauthorized access.</p>
<div class="align-center figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/dataplane.png"><img alt="alternate text" src="_images/dataplane.png" style="width: 800px; height: 300px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>After a device passed the network access control phrase, the switch perform device fingerprinting and attempt to discover
the Device Type/ Vendor Type/ Operating System/ and OS version via different means such as mac-address, dhcp, http agent etc.
These information collected formed the context of the user/device which in turns is used to derive the appropriate network policy.
The switch subsequently classify the user/device into the relevant service/vlan based on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mac-address (static associated)</li>
<li>IP address (static associated)</li>
<li>Contextual information (dynamic derived associated)</li>
</ul>
<p>Before the user/device is given full access, the switch can limit the access based on the posture of the device (PC in particular).
An OnGuard agent can be pre-installed in the PC to check the PC for compliance; and only allow the PC full access if the device passed
all the compliance checks.  Posture check implementation is optional.</p>
<p>The OnGuard agent can check for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Installed applications</li>
<li>Anti-Virus pattern file agencies</li>
<li>Host Firewall status</li>
<li>Network connections</li>
<li>Patch Management</li>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Virtual Machine</li>
<li>Processes</li>
<li>Windows Hotfixes</li>
<li>USB / File checks</li>
</ul>
<p>The OnGuard agent continue to check for compliance throughout the entire session.  Should the device failed the checklist or policy
at anythime, the policy manager will revoke the network access.  This is achieved via Radius COA or OnGuard agent-bounced.</p>
<p>Besides the OnGuard agent, the switch also perform various security functions to protect the network.  These includes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Flood control - Limit broadcast, multicase, and unknown-unicast</li>
<li>Microsegmentation - Port / Device level acl</li>
<li>Quarantine Manager - quarantine device that trigger security events on IDS/IPS/Firewall</li>
<li>MACSec - Layer 2 point-to-point encryption between two switches</li>
<li>User behaviour (Wireless only) - reports all the sessions of the users for further processing</li>
<li>App Visibility (req. DPI) - provide App visibility of the network through OmniVista 2500</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="control-management-plane">
<h3>Control &amp; Management plane<a class="headerlink" href="#control-management-plane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>OmniSwitch implements multiple features to ensure the control and management plane is protected from external threats.</p>
<p>Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise and LGS Innovations have combined to provide the first network equipment to be hardened by an independent group.
CodeGuardian promotes security and assurance at the network device level using independent verification and validation of source code, software diversification to prevent exploitation and secure delivery of software to customers.
CodeGuardian employs multiple techniques to identify vulnerabilities such as software architecture reviews, source code analysis (using both manual techniques and automated tools), vulnerability scanning tools and techniques, as well as analysis of known vulnerabilities in third party code.</p>

</div>
<p>OmniSwitch provide secure access to network administrator via SSH/ HTTPS / SFTP and SNMPv3.  All access can be protected by password policy and
the idetntify can be challenged against a AAA infrastructure.   In addition, the OmniSwitch AOS gives administrator the flexibile to bind
or unbind the management services to the respective IP interfaces.  Certainly, the AOS allow trusted host to access the switch management plane.</p>
<p>Besides controlling management access, OmniSwitch AOS also guard the switch against DDoS attacks.  The built-in DDoS filtering
capability protects the CPU against attacks such as ICMP Ping of death, Land attach, ARP Flood attach, Invalid IP attack etc.</p>
<p>Control plane protection is also one of the crucial feature of OmniSwitch AOS.
OmniSwitch AOS implements standard-based protocol authentication to guard against learning or sharing routing information
with unauthorized devices.  In addition, OmniSwitch AOS also include the key-chain management module that further enhance the
secure keys used in device authentication.</p>
<p>The keychain module is a centralized key management mechanism in AOS. Any module using key management service ensures enhanced security with regular rotation of the keys. Each keychain defines set of keys with start time and end time.
To configure a key chain, an administrator defines a series of keys, and the router software rotates through them. Each key also has an associated time interval, or ‘lifetime’ for which it will be activated. The authentication code included in each key is called the key string.
When a user application (like OSPF, ISIS) receives a packet, it has to be authenticated as per the authentication type, key, and message digest. When a keychain is associated with a user application, hello packets are authenticated using key provided by the keychain module.</p>
<p>The authentication is passed when following conditions are satisfied. Else, the adjacency is not formed and hello packet is discarded.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Current active key defined in keychain and key in the packet are same.</li>
<li>Authentication type of the current key in the keychain and the authentication type mentioned in the packet are same.</li>
<li>Message digest calculated by the keychain manager based on the active key and message digest carried in the packet are same.</li>

<div class="section" id="ethernet-oam">
<h2>Ethernet OAM<a class="headerlink" href="#ethernet-oam" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ethernet OAM focuses on two main areas that service providers require the most and are rapidly evolving in the standards bodies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Service OAM (IEEE 802.1ag and ITU-T Y.1731)—for monitoring and troubleshooting end-to-end Ethernet service instances.</li>
<li>Link OAM (IEEE 802.3ah EFM Link OAM)—for monitoring and troubleshooting individual Ethernet links.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two protocols are both unique and complimentary. For example, Service OAM may isolate a fault down to a specific service, but to determine exactly where the fault occurred within the network infrastructure might also require the use of Link OAM.</p>
<p>Ethernet Service OAM allows service providers to manage customer services end-to-end on a per-service- instance basis. A customer service instance, or Ethernet Virtual Connection (EVC), is the service that is sold to a customer and is designated by a VLAN tag on the User-to-Network Interface (UNI).</p>

<h3>CFM Maintenance Domain<a class="headerlink" href="#cfm-maintenance-domain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CFM uses a hierarchical Maintenance Domain (MD) infrastructure to manage and administer Ethernet networks.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each domain is made up of Maintenance Endpoints (MEPs) and Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs).</li>
<li>The MEPs are configured on edge ports within the domain for each EVC. The MIPs are configured on relevant ports within the domain itself (interior ports).</li>
<li>The network administrator selects the relevant points within the network to determine where maintenance points are needed. The maintenance point configuration defines the MD.</li>
<li>MDs are assigned an unique level number (between 0 and 7) to help identify and differentiate the MD within the domain hierarchy. For example, different organizations, such as operators (levels 0, 1, 2), service providers (levels 3, 4), and customers (levels 5, 6, 7), are involved in a Metro Ethernet Service.</li>
<li>Each organization can have its own Maintenance Domain, designated by the assigned level number to specify the scope of management needed for that domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following illustration shows an example of the CFM Maintenance Domain hierarchy:</p>

<h3>Fault Management<a class="headerlink" href="#fault-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Service OAM Connectivity Fault Management consists of three types of messages that are used to help network administrators detect, verify, and isolate when a problem occurs in the network:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Continuity Check Messages (CCM)—These are multicast messages exchanged periodically by MEPs to detect loss of service connectivity between MEPs. These messages are also used by MEPs and MIPs to discover other MEPs within a domain.</li>
<li>Linktrace Messages (LTM)—These messages are transmitted by a MEP to trace the path to a destination maintenance point. The receiving maintenance point responds to LTMs with a linktrace reply (LTR). This mechanism is similar to the UDP Trace Route function. The transmission of linktrace messages is requested by an administrator.</li>
<li>Loopback Messages (LBM)—These messages are transmitted by a MEP to a specified MIP or MEP to determine whether or not the maintenance point is reachable. The receiving maintenance point responds to LBMs with a loopback reply (LBR). This mechanism is not used to discover a path to the destination; it is similar to the Ping function. The transmission of loopback messages is requested by an administrator.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="remote-fault-propagation">
<h3>Remote Fault Propagation<a class="headerlink" href="#remote-fault-propagation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Remote Fault propagation (RFP) propagates connectivity fault events into the interface that is attached to a MEP. Once the fault is detected for a MEP, the MEP’s interface is shutdown. The feature is configurable on per MEP basis and is supported only for UP MEPs. It detects only loss of connectivity and remote MAC defect.
When a point-to-point connection is emulated with a Layer 2 SPB service, it is necessary to propagate connectivity faults from one end of the service tunnel to the other end. This allows a locally connected device to detect a connectivity fault in the SPB service and take action (such as enable a redundant link or send a trap) in response to the detected fault. Remote Fault Propagation (RFP) for SPB provides this type of fault detection and propagation from one end of an SPB service to the other.
The RFP functionality is applied to the SPBM service (data plane) layer. Connectivity fault events are propagated into an SPB Service Access Point (SAP). A SAP is associated with an SPB access port and a service instance identifier (I-SID). When a SAP port goes down, the SAP port on the other end of the service is also brought down. Without the RFP for SPB feature, the other end would continue to transmit packets waiting for a response.
Ethernet OAM messaging is used to detect a failed condition and propagate the fault. An OAM Continuity Check Message (CCM) is sent at specified intervals between SAPs to advertise the status of SAP components (such as the SPB access port and I-SID information).
This implementation of RFP for SPB involves setting up the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">An underlying SPB network infrastructure. RFP will monitor SPB access ports, which are bound to SAPs. A SAP consists of an access port, SPB service ID, and an encapsulation value (the VLAN tags that the SAP will process on the access ports).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">An RFP domain, which consists of local maintenance end points (MEPs) with remote end point lists that are assigned to the same RFP domain ID.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>A local MEP defines the RFP domain parameters, such as the RFP domain ID, level, and CCM interval. An ID number is assigned to the local MEP to identify the local switch as a participant in an RFP OAM domain.</li>
<li>A remote end point list identifies the SPB services to monitor and the remote end points (the MEP IDs of remote switches) to which the status of the services is advertised. Configuring the remote end point list of an RFP domain triggers the sending of CCM packets.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A reserved Ethernet OAM domain to which the RFP domain is mapped. When the local MEP of an RFP domain is configured, an OAM domain is automatically created based on the parameters specified when the local RFP MEP was created.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram shows how RFP works in a sample SPBM network topology:</p>
<div class="align-center figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/rfpspb.png"><img alt="alternate text" src="_images/rfpspb.png" style="width: 800px; height: 500px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>In this sample SPBM topology:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An RFP local MEP and a remote end point list are configured on each Backbone Edge Bridge (BEB). Both are assigned to the same RFP domain ID on each BEB to identify the end points as participating members of the RFP domain.</li>
<li>Each local MEP is assigned an ID number, which is used as the virtual UP MEP ID. In this example, the virtual UP MEP ID is 1 for BEB-1, 2 for BEB-2, 3 for BEB-3, and 4 for BEB-4.</li>
<li>Each remote end point list specifies the SPB services to monitor and the MEP IDs of remote BEBs to which the status of the services is advertised. For example, the remote end point list on BEB-1 contains the monitored SPB services and local MEP IDs for BEB-2, BEB-3, and BEB-4.</li>
<li>The remote end point list binds an SPB service ID to the RFP domain. The service ID is associated with a service instance identifier (I-SID) and a SAP, which identifies the SPB service instance and access port to monitor. For example, on the BEB-2 switch, the status of I-SID 1500 on access port 2/1 is monitored and advertised to BEB-1.</li>
<li>CCM packets transmitted on the RFP domain advertise I-SID and access port status information for the local SAP. The SAP information to advertise is identified through the SPB service ID that is associated with the RFP domain. For example, BEB-1 and BEB-2 both advertise the status of SAP port 1/1 and SAP port 2/1 for I-SID 1500. The same SPB service ID is mapped to each of these SAPs, which means the same I-SID is mapped to each of these SAPs.</li>
<li>When port 2/1 goes down on BEB-2, the service represented by I-SID 1500 stops transmitting. The CCM packets transmitted between BEB-2 and BEB-1 detect and advertise the port down fault. This causes BEB-1 to administratively down port 1/1 in response to the fault condition</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fault Detection</strong></p>
<p>Each BEB in the RFP domain will check the I-SID and port state information contained in the received CCM packets.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If any port state has transitioned from up to down, the local SAP port associated with the same I-SID is also brought down as a port violation.</li>
<li>When a CCM indicates that the downed port has transitioned back to an up state, the local port violation is cleared.</li>
<li>After a port violation is cleared, a 10 second timer is started to avoid bringing down the local ports immediately. This allows for the scenario in which a port violation is manually cleared on one BEB and by the time the violation is cleared on another BEB, a CCM packet from the other BEB is received with SAP port down information.</li>
<li>If a BEB device goes down, the information about the BEB will time out on remote BEB devices after 3 multiplied by the value of the CCM interval (3*CCM interval value). For example, if the CCM interval value is set to 100ms, a remote BEB will wait 300ms before timing out the information about the BEB that went down. The local physical SAP access port mapped to the I-SID that timed out is then brought down as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MIP CCM Database Support</strong></p>
<p>Per section 19.4 of the IEEE 802.1ag 5.2 draft standard, an MHF may optionally maintain a MIP CCM database as it is not required for conformance to this standard. A MIP CCM database, if present, maintains the information received from the MEPs in the MD and can be used by the Linktrace Protocol.
This implementation of Ethernet OAM does not support the optional MIP CCM database. As per section 19.4.4 of the IEEE 802.1ag 5.2 draft standard, LTM is forwarded on the basis of the source learning filtering database. Because the MIP CCM database is not supported in this release, MIPs will not forward LTM on blocked egress ports.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>The ITU-T Y.1731 Recommendation addresses the need to monitor performance to help enforce customer service level agreements (SLAs). Frame delay (latency) and frame delay variation (jitter) are important performance objectives, especially for those applications (such as voice) that cannot function with a high level of latency or jitter.
This implementation of Service OAM supports Ethernet frame delay measurement (ETH-DM) and is compliant with Y.1731. The ETH-DM feature allows for the configuration of on-demand OAM to measure frame delay and frame delay variation between endpoints.
Frame delay measurement is performed between peer MEPs (measurements to MIPs are not done) within the same MA. Although the OmniSwitch implementation of ETH-DM is compliant with ITU-T Y.1731, delay measurement can be performed for both ITU-T Y.1731 and IEEE 802.1ag MEPs.
Any MEP can initiate or reply to an ETH-DM request, depending on the type of delay measurement requested. There are two types of delay measurements supported: one-way and two-way</p>
<p>One-way ETH-DM</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A MEP sends one-way delay measurement (1DM)) frames to a peer MEP. The sending MEP inserts the transmission time into the 1DM frame at the time the frame is sent.</li>
<li>When a MEP receives a 1DM frame, the MEP calculates the one-way delay as the difference between the time at which the frame was received and the transmission time indicated by the frame timestamp (receive time minus transmission time).</li>
<li>One-way delay measurement statistics are gathered and stored on the receiving MEP (the MEP that receives a 1DM request).</li>
<li>One-way ETH-DM requires clock synchronization between the sending and receiving MEPs. Using NTP for clock synchronization is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two-way ETH-DM</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A MEP sends delay measurement message (DMM) frames to a peer MEP to request a two-way ETH-DM. The sending MEP inserts the transmission time into the DMM frame at the time the frame is sent.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When a MEP receives a DMM frame, the MEP responds to the DMM with a delay message reply (DMR) frame that contains the following timestamps:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Timestamp copied from the DMM frame.</li>
<li>Timestamp indicating when the DMM frame was received.</li>
<li>Timestamp indicating the time at which the receiving MEP transmitted the DMR frame back to the sending MEP.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When a MEP receives a DMR frame, the MEP compares all the DMR timestamps with the time at which the MEP received the DMR frame to calculate the two-way delay.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The two-way delay is the difference between the time the originating MEP sent a DMM request and the time at which the originating MEP received a DMR frame minus the time taken by the responding MEP to process the DMM request.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Two-way delay measurement statistics are gathered and stored on the originating MEP (the MEP that initiates a DMM request).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">This method does not require clock synchronization between the transmitting and receiving MEPs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Two-way ETH-DM is an on-demand OAM performance measurement. To set up continuous two-way delay measurement, see Chapter 40, “Configuring Service Assurance Agent,” for information about how to configure a SAA for continuous two-way frame delay measurement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Frame Delay Variation</strong></p>
<p>The delay variation (jitter) for both one-way and two-way ETH-DM is determined by calculating the difference between the current delay measurement value and the previous delay measurement value. If a previous delay value is not available, which is the case when a DM request is first made, then jitter is not calculated.</p>
<p><strong>Interoperability with ITU-T Y.1731</strong></p>
<p>This implementation of Ethernet Service OAM supports both IEEE 802.1ag and ITU-T Y.1731 for connectivity fault management (plus performance monitoring provided by ITU-T Y.1731). Although both standards are supported, the OmniSwitch implementation uses the 802.1ag terminology and hierarchy for Ethernet CFM configuration</p>

<div class="section" id="service-assurance-agent">
<h3>Service Assurance Agent<a class="headerlink" href="#service-assurance-agent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Service Assurance Agent (SAA) feature is used to send periodic ping or loopback tests to peers over the network. This is done using standard IP ping packets, proprietary MAC pings, and Ethernet OAM tests. It is possible to configure a large number of test sessions on the switch, with each test having the ability to send notification traps and provide a method for determining network performance.
Each SAA test can specify threshold values for jitter and round-trip-time (RTT). When SAA processes an iteration of a test session, it will compare the results against the following criteria to see if an SNMP trap should be sent. A trap with the session name is sent if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>At least one packet is lost.</li>
<li>Warning: Average RTT/Jitter within 10% of threshold.</li>
<li>Critical: Average RTT/Jitter at or above threshold.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an SAA is created, an owner name is assigned to the agent. This name is based on the application that generated the SAA. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>CLI SAA owner name = “USER”</li>
<li>OmniVista owner name = “OV”</li>
<li>Shortest Path Bridging owner name = “SPB”</li>
</ul>
<p>The SAA feature also provides the ability to periodically record the last five iterations of all SAA sessions to an XML file on the local switch. The name of the XML file and the logging time interval are configurable SAA XML parameters.</p>
