OmniSwitch 6865 Hardened Access Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Industrial-grade, highly secure, intelligent switches for superior performance in mission-critical applications running in harsh environments or extreme temperatures.
Our newest generation of Hardened Ethernet LAN Switches offers the ideal solution for mission-critical applications that need to operate at extreme temperatures and meet stringent EMC/EMI requirements. A high-performance rugged switch that can be stacked to form a virtual chassis, it's designed to be deployed in transportation and traffic control systems, power utilities, video surveillance and other outdoor installations.

Industry-leading features such as SPB-M support and intelligent auto-provisioning ensure a fast, scalable and cost-efficient way of rolling out services at the edge. With a generous PoE budget and HPoE to power wireless access points, card readers, PTZ cameras, digital signages, sensors and more, you’ll stay secure, connected and productive, whatever the environment.

* Advanced industrial PoE capabilities with support for HPoE (75W)
* Enables dual ring redundant architectures with 2 built-in 10 Gigabit SFP+ ports that support 10 Gigabits and 1000-X
* IEEE 1588v2 PTP capabilities for precise, sub-microsecond timing requirements
* Virtual Chassis feature: connect up to 8 switches for redundancy and scalability
* Scalable network virtualization architecture over standard Ethernet fabric using SPB-M for bridging and routed services
* Auto-fabric technology simplifies installation and service provisioning
* Operates at a temperature range from -40°C to +74°C, withstands shock, vibrations and industrial level EMI/EMC tests
* Convection-cooled fanless model for increased reliability, MTBF and lower acoustics
